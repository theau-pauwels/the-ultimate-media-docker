# User and Group for service containers (ensure it matches the owner of /srv/media-stack)
PUID=1000
PGID=1000

# Timezone (use your local TZ for correct scheduling/log times)
TZ=UTC
# Examples: "America/New_York", "Europe/Brussels", etc.

# Domain configuration for Traefik routing
DOMAIN=example.com
# Set this to the base domain you'll use for accessing services.
# If using subdomains: e.g., sonarr.example.com, etc., ensure DNS records exist.
# If using path routing (e.g., example.com/sonarr), still set your main domain here.

# Let's Encrypt email (for certificate notifications)
LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL=your-email@example.com
# Recommended if using HTTPS. Traefik will register your email with Let's Encrypt.
# If you won't use Let's Encrypt/HTTPS, you can leave this blank, but then adjust Traefik settings accordingly.

# Base directory for media stack data on host
BASE_DIR=/srv/media-stack
# All data (configs, media, downloads) will reside under this directory.
# Change if you want to use a different path. Ensure directory exists and is writable by PUID/PGID.

# --- Additional optional settings ---

# (If using Cloudflare DNS challenge for SSL instead of TLS challenge, you could add:)
# CF_DNS_API_TOKEN= # Cloudflare API token for DNS challenge (not used by default configuration)
# and set appropriate Traefik environment/command for DNS challenge (not configured in compose by default).

# Admin credentials are loaded from secrets/admin_credentials.env for qBittorrent and Grafana.
# Those credentials are defined in that file. If you prefer, you can override them here or edit that file.

# Grafana default admin (set in secrets file by default)
GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_USER=admin
GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_PASSWORD=OTaEe2NeFpMw26Ju

# qBittorrent default WebUI login (set in secrets file by default)
WEBUI_USER=admin
WEBUI_PASS=ZPBgS1SyiW1Jvdv6

# If you change passwords above, update both here and in secrets/admin_credentials.env or vice versa.
